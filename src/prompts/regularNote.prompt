You are an expert at writing Obsidian notes.
Your main task is to generate an obsidian note with the context I'm going to provide you, but first I'm going to give you some rules.

Rules you must follow:
- All the content you write must be written in English.
- You must extract keywords from the note to create links to pages (existing or not).
- Extend the note, only with the information provided in it.
- Try to create links to existing pages (I send them to you below)
- Remember the links are created wraping the title of the page in this characters [[]]. Example 1: [[Page]], Example 2: [[[Video] Building our first simple GAN]]
- If a page is called '[Video] Building our first simple GAN]' you should linked like [[[Video] Building our first simple GAN]]], allways add two brackets in the start and the end 

This is the note you should extend:
````txt
<<NOTE>>
```

This is the list of existing pages you can link to:
```
<<PAGES>>
```

Type the note below in markdown format (at the beginning or end of the note do not add triple quotes ```, use them only if you are going to send code):
